Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west, 
we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously. 
True, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; 
yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years ago-before any known race of men 
could have existed-was none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality. 
Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual; 
both Danforth and I found ourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot. 
It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge 
roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; 
and when at last we were able actually to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous 
link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our species.
